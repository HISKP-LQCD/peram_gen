This is the invert code for twisted mass Wilson QCD

Version 5.2.0, commit e2007a0bfa7a6284396ea065067d0bc3f8faebcb
# The code is compiled with QPX intrinsics for Blue Gene/Q
# The code is compiled with -D_GAUGE_COPY
# The code is compiled with -D_USE_HALFSPINOR
# the code is compiled for non-blocking MPI calls (spinor and gauge)
# the code is compiled with MPI IO / Lemon
# the code is compiled with openMP support
# Periodic boundary conditions are used
# The lattice size is 48 x 24 x 24 x 24
# The local lattice size is 3 x 12 x 12 x 12
# Even/odd preconditioning is used
# beta = 6.000000 , kappa= 0.163255
# boundary conditions for fermion fields (t,x,y,z) * pi: 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
